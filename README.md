# FLOSS-Web-app
A web interface for FLOSS agricultural model

## Aims and Objectives
FLOSS is a farm simulation, aimed at improving understanding of farm systems, and in particular how climate impacts individual farms. This app aims to include three elements: a wiki documenting the FLOSS code; an interface allowing users to enter the model imputs and run a simulation of a particular farm; a user guide for this web interface.

Contact Ben Latham if you want to get involved.
Constraints: My (Ben Latham's) work on this project is as part of my MSc degree, as such it is important that all work on this project is clearly atributed to whomever carries out said work. In order to facilitate this I would ideally like to discuss the role any contributors will play before they begin work.

## Documentation

wiki coming soon...

## Licence
MIT, See Licence.txt. However please note that the weathergen data files are not included in this licence - and are included for convenience of testing the system only. Code included in the project (e.g. bootstrap, jquery, etc.) should also be under an MIT licence, and commented with a link to the apropriate licence.
